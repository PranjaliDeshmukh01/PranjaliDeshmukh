I find inspiration in the subtle hues of a sunset, the intricate patterns of leaves, and the serene flow of water. Capturing these moments through drawing and pictures allows me to connect deeply with nature's poetry. As Elbert Hubbard once said, "Art is not a thing; it is a way." This philosophy resonates with my approach to art, where each sketch is a reflection of the beauty that surrounds us.<br>Check out my Website :  <a href="https://seethroughmyeyes.my.canva.site/" target="_blank">See Through My Eyes</a></p>

Cooking is another avenue where I explore cultural flavors, experimenting with diverse cuisines to create delightful dishes. In my leisure time, I enjoy strumming the guitar, letting melodies express emotions words cannot, and engaging in a spirited game of badminton, which keeps me energized and grounded. These activities not only enrich my life but also fuel my creative spirit.</p>
